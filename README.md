# hello-world
It is my 1st repository and my first experience in code (I've choise Python3 as base, but also for little learning front-end stack HTML+CSS+JS, also C#(but not now - in future I Will), Freamworks(Django, Flask)+SQL+Virtualization(Docker, AWS, Azure(my favorite) ).
As I decide to become an full-stack web-dev, so I need stack of technologies for back-end and stack for front-end(it's much more eathier, as for me so I learning them as is...) and also I need offcourse training platform (some-kind 'free' source with huge community), and it is it))
I decide to use this repository for my web-site projects.
